    "Exception processing refers to the handling of unexpected events or errors that occur during the execution of a program. Here are three applications for exception processing:\n",
    "\n",
    "Error handling: One of the primary applications of exception processing is error handling. When a program encounters an error, it can throw an exception to indicate that something unexpected has occurred. This exception can then be caught by the program and handled appropriately. For example, if a file that a program is trying to access is not found, the program can throw a \"FileNotFound\" exception. The exception can be caught, and the program can take appropriate actions, such as prompting the user to select a different file or displaying an error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "Resource management: Another application of exception processing is in managing resources. Resources such as files, network connections, and database connections need to be acquired and released properly by a program. However, unexpected events such as power failures or network outages can prevent a resource from being released properly, leading to resource leaks. Exception processing can be used to catch such unexpected events and ensure that resources are released properly even in the event of an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Program flow control: Exception processing can also be used to control the flow of a program. For example, if a program encounters an error that it cannot recover from, it can throw an exception to terminate the program gracefully. Additionally, exceptions can be used to control the flow of a program by allowing it to jump to a specific section of code based on the type of exception that was thrown. This can be useful in situations where the program needs to handle different types of errors differently."

    "If an exception is not handled by the program, it will result in the program terminating abruptly, and an error message or stack trace will be displayed to the user. This can be a problem because it does not provide any information to the user about what went wrong or how to resolve the issue. It can also result in the loss of data or resources that were being used by the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if a program is reading data from a file and encounters an error, such as the file not being found, and the exception is not handled, the program will terminate, and any data that was read from the file will be lost. Similarly, if a program is connecting to a database and encounters an error, such as a connection timeout, and the exception is not handled, the program will terminate, and any resources that were allocated for the database connection will be lost.\n",

    "When an exception occurs in a script, there are several options for recovering from it. Here are some common strategies for recovering from exceptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Catch and handle the exception: This involves wrapping the code that might raise an exception in a try-except block. The try block contains the code that might raise an exception, and the except block contains the code that handles the exception. The except block can contain code to log the error, display an error message to the user, or take other appropriate actions to recover from the exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "Retry the operation: If the exception is caused by a temporary error, such as a network outage or a database connection timeout, it may be possible to recover from the exception by retrying the operation. This can be achieved by wrapping the code that might raise the exception in a loop that retries the operation until it succeeds or a maximum number of retries is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rollback changes: If the exception occurs during a transactional operation, such as updating a database, it may be necessary to roll back any changes made to the data before the exception occurred. This can be done using a try-except block that catches the exception and rolls back any changes made to the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Graceful termination: If the exception cannot be recovered from, it may be necessary to terminate the script gracefully to prevent further damage or data loss. This can be achieved by catching the exception and exiting the script or program in a controlled manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to choose an appropriate recovery strategy based on the specific exception and the context in which it occurred to ensure that the script can recover from errors and continue functioning correctly."

For example, attempting to access a non-existent key in a dictionary or calling a method on an object that does not support that method will result in a KeyError or AttributeError exception being raised, respectively. In such cases, the exception will propagate up the call stack until it is caught by a try-except block or reaches the top-level of the program, causing the program to terminate.\n",
