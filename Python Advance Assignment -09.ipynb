When you read or write to a text-mode file, Python automatically handles the encoding and decoding for you, so you can work with the file as if it contains text. In contrast, when you read or write to a binary-mode file, you get the raw bytes in and out, without any translation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Line endings: Text-mode files automatically handle line endings by translating between platform-specific line endings (e.g., \"\\r\\n\" on Windows, \"\\n\" on Unix) and the universal newline format (\"\\n\"). This means that when you read from a text-mode file, you will always see \"\\n\" as the line ending, regardless of the platform where the file was created. In contrast, binary-mode files do not perform any line-ending translation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Operations: Some operations (such as seeking to a specific byte offset) may behave differently between text-mode and binary-mode files. In text-mode files, seeking may be restricted to seek to a line boundary, depending on the platform and the mode in which the file was opened. In binary-mode files, seeking is unrestricted, and you can seek to any byte offset within the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data types: The data type that you read or write from a file may differ between text-mode and binary-mode files. In text-mode files, you typically read and write strings (i.e., str objects), which are automatically encoded and decoded as needed. In contrast, in binary-mode files, you read and write bytes (i.e., bytes objects), which represent raw binary data.\n",

    "The change in string types from Python 2.X to 3.X can have a significant effect on your code, especially if your code deals with text processing, file I/O, or network communication. Here are some of the main changes that you may need to be aware of:\n",
    "\n",
    "Unicode strings: In Python 3.X, all strings are Unicode strings, whereas in Python 2.X, strings are byte strings by default. This means that you need to be careful when dealing with non-ASCII characters, as they may need to be encoded and decoded properly when reading from or writing to files or communicating over the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Byte strings: Byte strings are still supported in Python 3.X, but they are now represented using the bytes type instead of the str type. This means that you need to use the b prefix to indicate a byte string literal, such as b\"hello\". Byte strings are useful when dealing with binary data or when you need to communicate with systems that use a different encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Print function: In Python 3.X, the print statement has been replaced with a print() function. This means that you need to use parentheses around the arguments, and that you can no longer use the comma to separate arguments. For example, print \"hello\", \"world\" in Python 2.X becomes print(\"hello\", \"world\") in Python 3.X.\n",
    "\n",
    "String formatting: String formatting has been improved in Python 3.X, and now uses the format() method instead of the % operator. This means that you need to use curly braces {} to indicate placeholders, and that you can use named placeholders and format specifiers. For example, \"{} is {} years old\".format(\"Alice\", 30).\n",
    "\n",
    "Encoding/decoding: In Python 3.X, you need to be explicit about encoding and decoding when dealing with text and byte strings. This means that you need to use the encode() and decode() methods to convert between the two types, and that you need to specify the encoding explicitly when reading from or writing to files or communicating over the network.\n",
