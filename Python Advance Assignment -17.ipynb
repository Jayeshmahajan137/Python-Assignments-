For example, in the string \"abcabcabc\", the pattern \"a.c\" using greedy syntax will match the entire string, while non-greedy syntax will match only \"abc\". To transform a greedy pattern into a non-greedy one, we can add a \"?\" after the quantifier (e.g. \"\", \"+\") or change a greedy quantifier (e.g. \"\") to its non-greedy counterpart (e.g. \"*?\"). We can also use the non-greedy repetition syntax, such as \"{m,n}?\", to match the shortest possible substring."
