    "Q1. What is a probability distribution, exactly? If the values are meant to be random, how can you predict them at all?\n",
    "\n",
    "A probability distribution is a statistical function that defines the likelihood of occurrence of each possible outcome in a random variable. It is a representation of the frequencies of different possible outcomes in a sample space. While the values themselves are random, their probabilities are not, and we can predict the likelihood of an event occurring by examining the probability distribution.\n",

    "\n",
    "Q2. Is there a distinction between true random numbers and pseudo-random numbers, if there is one? Why are the latter considered “good enough”?\n",
    "\n",
    "True random numbers are generated by physical processes that are inherently unpredictable, such as radioactive decay or atmospheric noise. Pseudo-random numbers, on the other hand, are generated by algorithms that use a seed value to produce a sequence of seemingly random numbers. While they are not truly random, they are considered \"good enough\" for most practical purposes, as they exhibit statistical properties similar to those of true random numbers and are computationally efficient.\n",

    "\n",
    "Q3. What are the two main factors that influence the behaviour of a \"normal\" probability distribution?\n",
    "\n",
    "The two main factors that influence the behavior of a normal probability distribution are the mean and the standard deviation. The mean determines the location of the peak of the distribution, while the standard deviation determines the width of the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Provide a real-life example of a normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "A real-life example of a normal distribution is the distribution of heights or weights in a large population.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. In the short term, how can you expect a probability distribution to behave? What do you think will happen as the number of trials grows?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the short term, a probability distribution can behave unpredictably due to the randomness of the values. However, as the number of trials grows, the distribution of values will tend to converge to the expected probability distribution, as described by the law of large numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. What kind of object can be shuffled by using random.shuffle?\n",
    "\n",
    "The random.shuffle function can shuffle any mutable sequence object in Python, such as a list or tuple.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. Describe the math package's general categories of functions.\n",
    "\n",
    " The math package's general categories of functions include mathematical constants, arithmetic functions, trigonometric functions, logarithmic functions, and exponential functions.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. What is the relationship between exponentiation and logarithms?\n",
    "\n",
    "Exponentiation and logarithms are inverse operations. Exponentiation involves raising a base number to a given power, while logarithms involve determining the exponent to which a base number must be raised to produce a given value. In other words, if a^b = c, then log_a(c) = b.\n",

    "Q9. What are the three logarithmic functions that Python supports?\n",
    "\n",
    "The three logarithmic functions that Python supports are the natural logarithm (math.log(x)), the base-10 logarithm (math.log10(x)), and the base-2 logarithm (math.log2(x)).\n"
