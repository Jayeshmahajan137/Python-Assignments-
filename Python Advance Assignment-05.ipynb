    "Multiple inheritance is a feature of object-oriented programming languages, including Python, that allows a class to inherit from multiple base classes. This means that a subclass can have multiple parent classes, and it can inherit attributes and methods from all of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, when a class inherits from multiple base classes, the order in which the base classes are listed matters. This is because when a method or attribute is called on an instance of the subclass, Python searches for the method or attribute in each of the parent classes in the order they were listed in the subclass definition, until it finds a matching method or attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple inheritance can be a powerful tool for creating complex class hierarchies, but it can also lead to complications and potential conflicts if the base classes have conflicting names or attributes. To avoid these issues, it is important to carefully design class hierarchies and use multiple inheritance only when it is appropriate and necessary for the problem at hand."
