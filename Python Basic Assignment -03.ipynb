    "# Q1.Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "functions provide a number of benefits that make them extremely useful in programs\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Organization :-\n",
    "\n",
    "A function is almost like a mini-program that we can write separately from the main program\n",
    "This allows us to reduce a complicated program into smaller,which reduces the overall complexity of our program.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Reusability:-\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a function is written, it can be called multiple times from within the program. This avoids duplicated code and minimizes the probability of copy/paste errors. Functions can also be shared with other programs, reducing the amount of code that has to be written from scratch (and retested) each time.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Testing :-\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "because functions are self-contained, once we’ve tested a function to ensure it works, we don’t need to test it again unless we change it. This reduces the amount of code we have to test at one time, making it much easier to find bugs (or avoid them in the first place).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Extensibility:-\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When we need to extend our program to handle a case it didn’t handle before, functions allow us to make the change in one place and have that change take effect every time the function is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Abstraction:-\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to use a function, you only need to know its name, inputs, outputs, and where it lives. You don’t need to know how it works, or what other code it’s dependent upon to use it. This lowers the amount of knowledge required to use other people’s code (including everything in the standard library).\n",
