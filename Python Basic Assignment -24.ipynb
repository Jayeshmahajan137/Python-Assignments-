    "Ans:-\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Lambda functions are used when you need a function for a short period of time. This is commonly used when you want to pass a function as an argument to higher-order functions, that is, functions that take other functions as their arguments.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   AWS Lambda allows you to integrate your application server needs with mass-mailing services such as SES. Thus, you can consolidate more of the functionality your team requires to operate under one house. This not only reduces administrative costs but also makes your team's workflow more streamlined and efficient."
